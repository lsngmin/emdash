Adds a `media_picker` Block Kit element: a thumbnail preview with a modal library picker and mime-type filter. Usable in plugin block forms and in Block Kit field widgets. The stored value is the selected asset's URL string, so it is value-compatible with a plain `text_input` — existing content continues to work after swapping. The `mime_type_filter` is restricted to image MIME types (`image/` or `image/<subtype>`); wildcards and non-image types are rejected.
